## Forked so we could add custom functionality needed for Design System.
To update this repo and install it in DS:

**In this repo**
* 1. Make your changes to the code
* 2. npm run build:modern
* 3. commit and push.

**In uxui-snow-designsystem repo**
* 1. you might need to remove react-hook-form from node_modules so new code is installed properly.
* 2. npm update AlbinDalebySnow/react-hook-form

#### Link to original repo: [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form)
