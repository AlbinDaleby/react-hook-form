## Forked so we could add custom functionality needed for Design System.
To update this repo and install it in DS:

**In this repo**
* Make your changes to the code
* npm run build:modern
* Commit and push.

**In uxui-snow-designsystem repo**
* You might need to remove react-hook-form from node_modules so new code is installed properly.
* npm update AlbinDalebySnow/react-hook-form
