## Forked so we could add custom functionality needed for Design System.
- To update this repo and install it in DS:
- 1. Make your changes to the code
- 2. npm run build:modern
- 3. commit and push.
- 4. In uxui-react-designsystem:
a. you might need to remove react-hook-form from node_modules.
b. npm update AlbinDalebySnow/react-hook-form
